The common modules is a collection of modules, that we need in order to create a sudoku game. We have the `print_sudoku` module that prints a given sudoku puzzel in two dimensional array. The `unique_solver` module that returns the first solution copied into an array, and an int indicating the number of solutions, and `myalloc` module that allocates a 2d array of needed size.
